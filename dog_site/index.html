        <main>Your dog is your best friend but there's a lot you might not know about him! Whether your dog is young or old, these fun facts about dogs will give you 101 new reasons to love your furry friend:

Puppies love games such as hide and seek! Hide, then call your pup's name so she can try to find you.

Dogs can learn more than 1000 words.

Big happy "helicopter" tail wagging is one sign of a really nice dog

Upright, stiff, rapid tail movement is not wagging or "friendly" but indicates a dog who's rather excited and focused.

Puppies grow to half their body weight in the first four to five months!

Puppies then take a year or more to gain the other half of their body weight.

Puppies can sleep 18 to 20 hours a day during that rapid body growth phase.

Dogs sometimes appear to smile — much like humans — with open mouth grinning. This may indicate a relaxed, submissive state.

Tired puppies get cranky just like little kids. If you have a fussy puppy, try nap time.

The fastest breed, the Greyhound, can run up to 44 miles per hour.

Perky-eared dogs hear sounds better than floppy-eared dogs.

There are about 400 million dogs in the world.

The Labrador Retriever is the most popular breed, according to the American Kennel Club.

There are hundreds of breeds of dogs.</main>

      <div class="c5">My name is Benjamin Koshy. I am a pet owner and animal lover.
      I grew up in India and I can never remember a time when I didn't have a pet.
    I love cats and dogs and and pretty much everything else on this planet.
  Most of my pets were rescues. And I am a huge advocate of saving animals lives.
I am also a web developer. Front end for now, but my goal is to become full stack by the end of this year.  </div>
